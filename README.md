# ðŸŽ¬ CineReco: A Movie Recommendation System using NLP & Machine Learning

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

CineReco is an AI-powered movie recommendation system that uses Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning to provide personalized recommendations. It also includes sentiment analysis to evaluate movie reviews.

## ðŸš€ Features

- âœ… Personalized Movie Recommendations using TF-IDF & Cosine Similarity.
- âœ… Sentiment Analysis using NaÃ¯ve Bayes classifier on movie reviews.
- âœ… NLP-based Text Preprocessing for better feature extraction.
- âœ… **Case-Insensitive Movie Title Matching**: users can input movie titles in any case (e.g., `avatar`, `AVATAR`, `Avatar`) and still get accurate results.
- âœ… **Title Deduplication**: ensures recommendations are not repeated for the same movie.
- âœ… **Accurate Title Output**: returns recommended movies with original, correctly cased titles.
- âœ… **Excludes Self-Recommendation**: filters out recommending the movie itself.
- âœ… Exception Handling for missing datasets and invalid inputs.

## ðŸ”§ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-Learn (ML & NLP models)
- NLTK (Text Processing)

## ðŸ“‚ Installation & Usage

### Clone the repository:


git clone https://github.com/shivam15112003/CineReco-A-Movie-Recommendation-System-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning.git
cd CineReco-A-Movie-Recommendation-System-using-NLP-and-Machine-Learning
Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Run the program:
```bash
python cine_reco.py
```bash
Enter a movie title (any case) to get recommendations.


## ðŸ“ˆ Future Enhancements
- Add Deep Learning-based recommendation models.
- Integrate with movie streaming platforms.
- Improve personalization using collaborative filtering.
- Enhance recommendation accuracy using additional metadata.
- Build a web-based or GUI version for improved user experience.


## Note:
The system now uses a helper lowercase column title_lower internally to handle case-insensitive matching, while preserving the original movie titles for output display.
